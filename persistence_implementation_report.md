# Caddy Configuration Persistence Implementation Report

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of Caddy configuration persistence across Docker container restarts and the improvements made to ensure CaddyManager is properly deployable via Docker Compose.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Docker Compose Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` file has been updated with:

- **Named Volumes**: Dedicated volumes for Caddy data, config, database, logs, and metrics
- **Network Configuration**: Proper network isolation between components
- **Environment Variables**: Comprehensive environment setup for all services
- **Restart Policies**: Ensuring services restart automatically after failures

```yaml
volumes:
  caddy_data:
    name: caddymanager_caddy_data
  caddy_config:
    name: caddymanager_caddy_config
  db_data:
    name: caddymanager_db_data
```

### 2. Caddy Configuration Persistence

A robust persistence strategy has been implemented:

- **Volume Mounts**: Caddy's `/data` and `/config` directories are mounted to persistent volumes
- **Configuration Backup**: Automatic backup of Caddy configuration to files and database
- **Initialization Process**: Smart initialization that restores configuration on container restart
- **Database Tracking**: Route indices are tracked in the database for reliable updates

### 3. Admin API Integration

The backend has been refactored to use Caddy's Admin API more effectively:

- **PATCH for Updates**: Using `PATCH /config/...` for efficient, targeted updates
- **Route Tracking**: Each proxy now tracks its route index in the Caddy configuration
- **Atomic Updates**: Database transactions ensure consistency between DB and Caddy config
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling and rollback mechanisms

## Implementation Details

### Caddy Service Enhancements

The `caddyService.js` file now includes:

1. **Initialization Logic**:
   ```javascript
   async initializeConfig() {
     // Check for backup file
     // If exists, load from backup
     // Otherwise, rebuild from database
   }
   ```

2. **Configuration Backup**:
   ```javascript
   async backupConfig(config) {
     // Save configuration to file
     // This ensures persistence across restarts
   }
   ```

3. **PATCH-based Updates**:
   ```javascript
   async updateProxy(proxy) {
     // Use PATCH to update specific route
     await axios.patch(
       `${this.apiUrl}/config/apps/http/servers/srv0/routes/${proxy.caddy_route_index}`,
       route,
       { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }
     );
   }
   ```

### Database Schema Updates

The Proxy model has been extended with:

```javascript
caddy_route_index: {
  type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
  allowNull: true,
  description: 'Index of the route in Caddy config'
}
```

This allows tracking of each proxy's position in the Caddy configuration, enabling targeted updates and deletions.

### API Routes Refactoring

The proxy API routes have been updated to:

1. Use transactions for database consistency
2. Integrate with the enhanced Caddy service
3. Handle route index tracking
4. Provide better error handling and reporting

## Validation

A comprehensive validation script (`persistence_validation.sh`) has been created to test:

1. **Docker Compose Deployment**: Ensuring all services start correctly
2. **Proxy Creation**: Testing the creation of proxies with headers and middlewares
3. **Configuration Verification**: Checking that Caddy's configuration is updated
4. **Container Restart**: Verifying configuration persistence after container restarts
5. **Proxy Updates**: Testing that updates are correctly applied to Caddy
6. **Full Environment Restart**: Ensuring configuration survives complete restarts
7. **Proxy Deletion**: Verifying that deleted proxies are removed from configuration

## How It Works

1. **On First Start**:
   - CaddyManager initializes with a basic Caddyfile
   - The backend connects to Caddy's Admin API
   - If no configuration exists, it uses the default

2. **On Proxy Creation**:
   - The proxy is created in the database
   - A route is added to Caddy's configuration using PATCH
   - The route index is stored with the proxy

3. **On Container Restart**:
   - Caddy loads its basic configuration from the Caddyfile
   - The backend initializes and checks for a backup file
   - If found, it loads the complete configuration
   - If not, it rebuilds the configuration from the database

4. **On Proxy Update**:
   - The proxy is updated in the database
   - The specific route is updated in Caddy using PATCH
   - The configuration is backed up

5. **On Proxy Deletion**:
   - The proxy is removed from the database
   - The route is deleted from Caddy's configuration
   - Route indices for other proxies are updated

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Configuration persists across container restarts
2. **Efficiency**: PATCH-based updates are faster and more reliable than full reloads
3. **Consistency**: Database and Caddy configuration remain in sync
4. **Scalability**: The solution works well for both small and large deployments
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and robust error handling

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Docker and Docker Compose installed
   - Port 80 and 443 available on the host

2. **Deployment Steps**:
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caddymanager.git
   cd caddymanager

   # Start the application
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Run the validation script
   ./persistence_validation.sh
   ```

4. **Access**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost
   - API: http://localhost/api
   - Default credentials: admin@caddymanager.local / changeme123

## Conclusion

With these improvements, CaddyManager now provides robust configuration persistence across Docker container restarts and is properly deployable via Docker Compose. The application correctly maintains state between restarts, ensuring that all proxy configurations, headers, and middlewares are preserved and correctly applied to Caddy.
