## Development Process

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
4. Make your changes
5. Run tests
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Create a Pull Request

### Coding Standards

#### JavaScript/TypeScript

* Use ES6+ features
* Use async/await over promises
* Follow the ESLint configuration
* Use TypeScript types/interfaces where possible
* Document functions and complex logic

#### React

* Use functional components and hooks
* Follow React best practices
* Keep components small and focused
* Use proper prop-types or TypeScript interfaces

#### Testing

* Write unit tests for new features
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Include integration tests where necessary
* Aim for good test coverage

## Git Commit Messages

* Use semantic versioning wording:
    * `feat:` for new features (triggers MINOR version bump)
    * `fix:` for bug fixes (triggers PATCH version bump)
    * `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit body for breaking changes (triggers MAJOR version bump)
    * `chore:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:` for other changes
* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Examples:
```
feat: add user authentication system
fix: resolve memory leak in proxy manager
BREAKING CHANGE: refactor API endpoints to follow REST conventions
docs: update installation instructions
chore: update dependencies
```
