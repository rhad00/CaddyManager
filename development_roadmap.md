# CaddyManager Development Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the development plan for CaddyManager, an open-source reverse proxy manager built on Caddy Server with a web-based UI and REST API backend. The project aims to provide functionality similar to NPMPlus but with Caddy's advantages and additional features for service-specific header templates.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture (Weeks 1-3)

### Week 1: Project Setup & Architecture Design
- Set up development environment and repository structure
- Define technology stack and dependencies
- Design database schema for users, proxies, and templates
- Create architectural diagrams for frontend, backend, and Caddy integration
- Establish coding standards and documentation practices
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

### Week 2: Backend Core & Caddy Integration
- Implement core backend framework (Node.js/Express or Go/Fiber)
- Create database models and migrations
- Develop Caddy API integration service
  - Configuration generation
  - JSON config push to Caddy Admin API
  - Health check and status monitoring
- Implement basic error handling and logging
- Create initial API endpoints structure

### Week 3: Authentication System
- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Create secure password hashing with argon2/bcrypt
- Develop user management system (CRUD operations)
- Implement role-based access control (Admin, Read-only)
- Add brute-force protection with rate limiting
- Create login, logout, and session persistence functionality
- Develop initial admin user setup mechanism

## Phase 2: Core Functionality (Weeks 4-7)

### Week 4: Proxy Management API
- Implement proxy host CRUD operations
- Develop domain validation and management
- Create SSL certificate management (ACME/Let's Encrypt integration)
- Implement HTTP to HTTPS redirection toggle
- Add compression options (gzip/zstd)
- Develop caching header controls

### Week 5: Header & Middleware Configuration
- Implement custom request/response header injection
- Create security headers management (CSP, XSS, HSTS)
- Develop forwarded headers handling
- Implement rate limiting middleware
- Add IP allow/block list functionality
- Create path-based proxying rules
- Implement basic auth middleware
- Develop redirect and rewrite rules

### Week 6: Service Templates
- Design template system architecture
- Implement predefined templates for common services:
  - Amazon S3
  - Authelia
  - Keycloak
  - Nextcloud
  - Cloudflare Tunnel
  - Grafana
  - Kibana/Elastic
- Create template management API (add/update/remove)
- Implement template merging with custom headers

### Week 7: Backup & Restore
- Implement configuration export to JSON
- Create import functionality from backup files
- Develop auto-backup on configuration changes
- Add SSL certificate backup and restore
- Implement encrypted local backups
- Create optional S3 cloud backup integration

## Phase 3: Frontend Development (Weeks 8-11)

### Week 8: UI Foundation & Authentication
- Set up React + TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI project
- Create responsive layout and navigation
- Implement authentication views (login/logout)
- Develop user profile management
- Create admin user management interface
- Implement role-based UI elements

### Week 9: Proxy Management UI
- Create dashboard overview with proxy list
- Implement system health monitoring display
- Develop SSL expiration status indicators
- Create proxy creation/editing interface
- Implement domain management UI
- Add SSL configuration options

### Week 10: Advanced Configuration UI
- Implement header and middleware configuration UI
- Create template selection interface
- Develop advanced options panels (rate limiting, auth, etc.)
- Add IP restriction management
- Implement redirect and rewrite rule interface
- Create path-based routing configuration

### Week 11: Utilities & Monitoring UI
- Implement backup and restore interface
- Create log viewer for access and error logs
- Develop system settings panel
- Add Caddy status monitoring dashboard
- Implement API key management for automation
- Create help and documentation sections

## Phase 4: Testing, Documentation & Deployment (Weeks 12-14)

### Week 12: Testing
- Implement unit tests for API routes, services, and utilities
- Create integration tests for database and Caddy interaction
- Develop E2E UI tests with Cypress
- Test templates with mock applications
- Perform load and regression testing
- Address bugs and performance issues

### Week 13: Documentation
- Create comprehensive API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- Write configuration guides
- Develop template documentation
- Create system design overview
- Write deployment and security guidelines
- Prepare user manual

### Week 14: Deployment & Release Preparation
- Finalize Docker and docker-compose configuration
- Create initialization scripts
- Test deployment in various environments
- Prepare release notes
- Create project website and documentation portal
- Plan community engagement and contribution guidelines

## Phase 5: Post-Release & Ongoing Development

### Immediate Post-Release (Weeks 15-16)
- Address critical bugs and issues
- Implement community feedback
- Enhance documentation based on user questions
- Create additional tutorials and examples

### Medium-Term Goals (Months 4-6)
- Add support for additional service templates
- Implement advanced monitoring and alerting
- Develop plugin system for extensions
- Create multi-node Caddy management
- Add support for additional databases

### Long-Term Vision (Months 7-12)
- Implement clustering and high availability
- Add support for custom Caddy modules
- Develop advanced analytics and reporting
- Create enterprise features (LDAP/SAML integration)
- Build community plugin marketplace
