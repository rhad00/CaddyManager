# CaddyManager: Getting Started Guide

This document provides practical recommendations for initiating development on the CaddyManager project. Following these steps will help establish a solid foundation for the project and ensure a smooth development process.

## Initial Development Steps

### 1. Environment Setup

Before diving into code development, it's essential to set up a proper development environment. This includes:

Setting up a development environment with Docker is highly recommended as it ensures consistency across different development machines and simplifies the integration with Caddy Server. The following steps outline the process:

Create a development directory structure following the project structure document. This provides a clear separation of concerns and makes the codebase more maintainable as it grows. The initial focus should be on establishing the core directories for both backend and frontend components.

Install the necessary development tools including Git for version control, Node.js or Go depending on your backend choice, and Docker with Docker Compose for containerization. These tools form the foundation of your development workflow and ensure consistency across different environments.

Set up a Git repository with appropriate .gitignore files to exclude node_modules, build artifacts, and environment-specific configurations. This helps maintain a clean repository and prevents committing sensitive information or unnecessary files.

Create initial Docker Compose configurations for development that include services for the backend, frontend, Caddy server, and database. This allows for isolated development and testing of each component while ensuring they can communicate with each other as needed.

### 2. Backend Foundation

The backend serves as the core of CaddyManager, handling authentication, proxy configuration, and Caddy integration. Start with:

Create the basic Express.js or Go application structure with initial routing setup. This establishes the framework for adding specific API endpoints and business logic as development progresses.

Implement the database connection and basic models for users and proxy configurations. This provides the data persistence layer necessary for storing configuration and user information.

Develop the authentication system with JWT token generation and validation. Security is paramount for a proxy manager, so establishing robust authentication early is crucial.

Create the initial admin user setup mechanism, either through environment variables or a first-time setup screen. This ensures that the system is secure from the first deployment and provides a way for administrators to access the system.

Implement the core Caddy API integration service that can generate and push configurations to Caddy's Admin API. This is the central functionality that allows CaddyManager to control Caddy Server and forms the foundation for all proxy management features.

### 3. Frontend Scaffolding

The frontend provides the user interface for managing proxies and configurations. Begin with:

Set up the React application with Vite, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN UI. This establishes the development environment for the frontend with modern tools that facilitate rapid UI development.

Create the basic layout components including navigation, sidebar, and content areas. These components form the structure of the application and provide a consistent user experience across different pages.

Implement the authentication views (login page) and context for managing user sessions. This allows users to authenticate with the backend and maintains their session state throughout the application.

Develop the dashboard overview page showing system status and proxy list. This provides users with immediate visibility into their proxy configurations and system health upon logging in.

Create the basic proxy management interface for listing, creating, and editing proxy configurations. This is the core functionality that users will interact with most frequently and forms the basis for more advanced features.

### 4. Caddy Integration Testing

Ensuring proper integration with Caddy Server is critical for the project's success:

Set up a local Caddy instance for development and testing. This provides a controlled environment for testing the integration between CaddyManager and Caddy Server without affecting production systems.

Create test cases for generating and applying Caddy configurations. These tests verify that the configuration generation logic produces valid Caddy configurations and that they can be successfully applied to a running Caddy instance.

Implement the configuration rollback mechanism for handling failed configurations. This ensures that the system can recover from configuration errors without leaving Caddy in an unusable state.

Test the SSL certificate management with Let's Encrypt in a development environment. This verifies that the automatic SSL certificate provisioning works correctly, which is a key feature for many users.

Develop monitoring for Caddy status and health. This allows CaddyManager to detect issues with Caddy Server and provide appropriate feedback to users.

### 5. Initial Feature Implementation

With the foundation in place, begin implementing core features:

Start with basic proxy host management (CRUD operations). This allows users to create, read, update, and delete proxy configurations, which is the fundamental functionality of the application.

Implement HTTP to HTTPS redirection toggle. This is a commonly used feature that provides security benefits with minimal configuration effort.

Add support for custom request and response headers. This allows users to customize the behavior of their proxies for specific use cases.

Implement basic authentication middleware for protected routes. This provides a simple way to secure access to specific proxies without requiring complex authentication systems.

Create the initial service template for a common service like Authelia or Keycloak. This demonstrates the template system's value and provides immediate utility for users with these services.

### 6. Testing and Documentation

Establish good practices for testing and documentation from the beginning:

Set up unit testing for backend services and API endpoints. This ensures that individual components work as expected and helps prevent regressions as the codebase evolves.

Create integration tests for the Caddy configuration workflow. These tests verify that the entire configuration process works correctly from user input to applied Caddy configuration.

Implement basic end-to-end tests for critical user flows. These tests ensure that the application works correctly from the user's perspective and catch issues that might not be apparent in unit or integration tests.

Start documenting the API with OpenAPI/Swagger. This provides clear documentation for the API endpoints, making it easier for developers to understand and use the API.

Create initial user documentation for installation and basic usage. This helps users get started with the application and reduces the support burden on the development team.

### 7. Continuous Integration Setup

Establish a CI/CD pipeline early to ensure code quality and simplify deployment:

Set up GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated testing. This ensures that all code changes are tested automatically before being merged, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

Implement linting and code formatting checks. These checks ensure consistent code style and catch common issues before they make it into the codebase.

Create Docker image builds for tagged releases. This provides a consistent way to package and distribute the application for deployment.

Establish a release process with semantic versioning. This helps users understand the impact of updates and ensures compatibility between components.

## Practical Development Workflow

To maintain momentum and ensure steady progress, consider the following workflow:

1. **Iterative Development Cycles**: Work in short (1-2 week) iterations focusing on specific features or components. This allows for regular feedback and adjustment of priorities as needed.

2. **Feature Branching**: Use feature branches for development, with pull requests for code review before merging to the main branch. This ensures code quality and provides documentation of changes.

3. **Regular Testing**: Run tests frequently during development to catch issues early. Automated testing in the CI pipeline ensures that all code changes are tested consistently.

4. **Documentation as You Go**: Update documentation as features are implemented rather than leaving it for later. This ensures that documentation stays current and reduces the burden of creating it all at once.

5. **User Feedback**: If possible, get early feedback from potential users on the UI design and feature implementation. This helps ensure that the application meets user needs and expectations.
