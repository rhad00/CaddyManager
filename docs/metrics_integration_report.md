# Caddy Metrics Monitoring Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of Caddy's metrics API integration into CaddyManager. This feature allows users to monitor the performance, health, and usage statistics of their Caddy server instances through a comprehensive dashboard.

## Features Implemented

### Backend Integration

1. **Metrics Service**
   - Created a dedicated service (`metricsService.js`) to fetch and parse metrics from Caddy's API
   - Implemented caching to reduce load on Caddy's admin API
   - Added support for historical data storage through snapshots
   - Provided methods to query specific metrics categories (HTTP, system, TLS)

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/metrics` - Get a summary of key metrics
   - `/api/metrics/http` - Get HTTP-related metrics
   - `/api/metrics/system` - Get system resource metrics
   - `/api/metrics/tls` - Get TLS-related metrics
   - `/api/metrics/historical` - Get historical metrics data
   - `/api/metrics/snapshot` - Create a metrics snapshot
   - `/api/metrics/raw` - Get raw metrics in Prometheus format (admin only)

3. **Security**
   - All endpoints are protected with authentication
   - Admin-only endpoints require appropriate role permissions
   - Rate limiting and caching implemented to prevent abuse

### Frontend Dashboard

1. **Overview Panel**
   - Summary cards showing key metrics (requests, memory, goroutines, TLS)
   - HTTP status code distribution chart
   - Request history line chart
   - Memory usage history line chart

2. **Detailed Metrics Panels**
   - HTTP metrics panel with detailed request statistics
   - System metrics panel with resource usage information
   - TLS metrics panel with certificate and handshake data

3. **User Experience**
   - Auto-refresh functionality with configurable intervals
   - Manual refresh button for immediate updates
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Interactive charts with tooltips and legends

## How to Use

1. **Access the Metrics Dashboard**
   - Log in to CaddyManager
   - Click on the "Metrics" tab in the main navigation

2. **View Different Metrics Categories**
   - Use the tabs within the metrics dashboard to switch between:
     - Overview (summary of all metrics)
     - HTTP Metrics (detailed request statistics)
     - System Metrics (resource usage information)
     - TLS Metrics (certificate and handshake data)

3. **Configure Refresh Rate**
   - Select your preferred auto-refresh interval from the dropdown
   - Click "Refresh Now" for immediate updates

4. **View Historical Data**
   - Historical charts show data over time
   - Hover over data points for detailed information

## Technical Implementation

### Backend

The metrics integration is built on a service-based architecture:

1. **Metrics Service**
   - Fetches raw metrics from Caddy's `/metrics` endpoint
   - Parses Prometheus-format metrics into structured data
   - Caches results to minimize API calls
   - Stores historical snapshots for trend analysis

2. **API Routes**
   - RESTful endpoints for accessing different metrics categories
   - Authentication middleware for security
   - Role-based access control for sensitive operations

### Frontend

The dashboard is implemented using:

1. **React Components**
   - Modular design with separate components for different metrics types
   - Responsive layout using TailwindCSS

2. **Chart.js Integration**
   - Interactive charts for data visualization
   - Multiple chart types (line, bar, doughnut) for different data representations

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Configurable polling for fresh data
   - Optimized to minimize network traffic

## Testing

A dedicated test script (`metrics_test.sh`) is provided to validate the metrics API integration:

1. **Endpoint Testing**
   - Validates all API endpoints
   - Checks response formats and data integrity
   - Verifies authentication and authorization

2. **Dashboard Testing**
   - Confirms proper data visualization
   - Validates refresh functionality
   - Tests responsive design

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements to the metrics monitoring feature:

1. **Alerting System**
   - Define thresholds for important metrics
   - Send notifications when thresholds are exceeded
   - Configure alert rules through the UI

2. **Extended Historical Data**
   - Implement longer-term data retention
   - Add data aggregation for efficient storage
   - Provide export functionality for analysis

3. **Advanced Visualizations**
   - Add more chart types and visualizations
   - Implement custom dashboard layouts
   - Support for user-defined metrics views

4. **Multi-server Support**
   - Aggregate metrics from multiple Caddy instances
   - Compare performance across servers
   - Centralized monitoring for distributed deployments
