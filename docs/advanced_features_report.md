# CaddyManager - Advanced Features Implementation Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the implementation of advanced features for CaddyManager, building upon the initial foundation. The enhancements include advanced Caddy integration with headers and middleware support, service templates for common applications, expanded frontend UI for comprehensive management, and backup/restore functionality.

## Completed Advanced Features

### Enhanced Caddy Integration
- Implemented header and middleware models for fine-grained proxy configuration
- Enhanced Caddy configuration generation to support custom headers and middleware
- Added support for different middleware types (rate limiting, IP filtering, basic auth, redirects)
- Improved error handling and configuration validation

### Service Templates
- Created template model and management system
- Implemented 7 predefined templates for common applications:
  - Authelia (authentication server)
  - Keycloak (identity management)
  - Amazon S3 (object storage)
  - Nextcloud (file sharing)
  - Cloudflare Tunnel
  - Grafana (monitoring)
  - Kibana/Elastic (logging)
- Added template application to proxies with proper header and middleware configuration

### Expanded Frontend UI
- Implemented comprehensive proxy management interface
  - List, create, edit, and delete proxies
  - Apply templates to proxies
  - Configure SSL, compression, and HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection
- Added template management interface
  - View available templates and their details
  - Examine template headers and middleware configurations
- Integrated all components in a tabbed dashboard interface

### Backup and Restore
- Implemented backup model and service
- Added automatic backup scheduling
- Created backup management API endpoints
- Implemented backup and restore UI
  - Create, download, restore, and delete backups
  - View backup details and status
- Added support for both manual and automatic backups

## Current State

The CaddyManager application now provides a comprehensive solution for managing Caddy Server as a reverse proxy with the following capabilities:

1. **Complete Proxy Management**: Create and manage proxy configurations with support for multiple domains, SSL options, and advanced settings.

2. **Header and Middleware Support**: Configure custom request and response headers, as well as middleware like rate limiting, IP filtering, and authentication.

3. **Service Templates**: Apply predefined configurations for common applications to quickly set up proxies with appropriate headers and middleware.

4. **Backup and Restore**: Create manual backups, schedule automatic backups, and restore configurations when needed.

5. **User-Friendly UI**: Manage all aspects of the application through an intuitive web interface with separate sections for proxies, templates, and backups.

## Running the Enhanced Application

To run the application with all new features:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `docker-compose up`
4. Access the frontend at http://localhost:5173
5. The backend API is available at http://localhost:3000
6. Default admin credentials: admin@caddymanager.local / changeme123

## Next Steps

For further development, consider:

1. **Implementing File Upload for Backups**: Add support for uploading backup files through the UI.

2. **Enhancing Template Management**: Allow users to create and edit templates through the UI.

3. **Adding Monitoring and Metrics**: Integrate with Caddy's metrics API to provide usage statistics and monitoring.

4. **Implementing Multi-Server Support**: Extend the application to manage multiple Caddy instances.

5. **Adding HTTPS Certificate Management**: Provide UI for managing custom SSL certificates.

## Conclusion

The implementation of advanced features has transformed CaddyManager into a robust, feature-rich reverse proxy manager with capabilities comparable to or exceeding similar tools. The application now provides a comprehensive solution for managing Caddy Server configurations through an intuitive web interface, with support for templates, advanced proxy settings, and backup/restore functionality.
