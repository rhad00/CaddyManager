# CaddyManager - Initial Implementation Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the initial implementation of CaddyManager, an open-source reverse proxy manager built on Caddy Server. The implementation follows the specifications provided and establishes a solid foundation for further development.

## Completed Work

### Repository and Project Structure
- Created a comprehensive directory structure for both backend and frontend
- Set up README files with detailed documentation
- Added appropriate .gitignore file
- Established a clear project organization following modern best practices

### Backend Foundation
- Initialized Node.js backend with Express
- Installed core dependencies (Express, Sequelize, bcrypt, JWT, etc.)
- Set up database configuration with support for both PostgreSQL and SQLite
- Created User and Proxy models with appropriate relationships
- Implemented authentication service with JWT and secure password hashing
- Added role-based access control (admin, read-only)
- Created authentication middleware for route protection
- Implemented Caddy API integration service for configuration management
- Set up initial admin user creation mechanism

### Frontend Foundation
- Scaffolded React application with Vite
- Installed and configured TailwindCSS and ShadCN UI
- Implemented authentication context for state management
- Created login page with form validation
- Set up protected routes with React Router
- Developed initial dashboard UI with responsive design
- Established communication with backend API

### Docker and Development Environment
- Created Dockerfiles for both backend and frontend
- Set up docker-compose.yml for containerized development
- Configured environment variables for development

## Current State

The current implementation provides:

1. **Authentication System**: Complete JWT-based authentication with secure password hashing and role-based access control.

2. **User Management**: Basic user CRUD operations with admin-only access to user creation.

3. **Proxy Management**: API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting proxy configurations.

4. **Caddy Integration**: Service for generating and applying Caddy configurations based on proxy settings.

5. **Frontend UI**: Login page and basic dashboard with responsive design.

## Next Steps

The following areas should be prioritized for continued development:

1. **Complete Caddy Integration**: Enhance the Caddy configuration generation to support all required features (headers, middleware, templates).

2. **Expand Frontend UI**: Implement proxy management screens, template selection, and advanced configuration options.

3. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for both backend and frontend.

4. **Service Templates**: Implement the template system for common services (Authelia, Keycloak, S3, etc.).

5. **Backup and Restore**: Add functionality for configuration backup and restore.

## Running the Application

To run the application in development mode:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `docker-compose up`
4. Access the frontend at http://localhost:5173
5. The backend API is available at http://localhost:3000
6. Default admin credentials: admin@caddymanager.local / changeme123

## Conclusion

The initial implementation provides a solid foundation for CaddyManager, with core functionality in place for authentication, user management, and basic proxy configuration. The architecture follows modern best practices and is designed for scalability and maintainability.

Further development should focus on expanding the feature set according to the roadmap, with particular emphasis on enhancing the Caddy integration and frontend user experience.
