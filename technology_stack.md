  - Passport.js offers flexible authentication strategies
  - JWT provides stateless authentication suitable for API services
  - bcrypt or Argon2 for secure password hashing
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
  - Automated API documentation generation
  - Interactive API testing interface
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest
  - Jest provides a comprehensive testing framework
  - Supertest enables API endpoint testing

#### Option 2: Go Stack (Recommended for Performance)

Go offers excellent performance characteristics and compiles to a single binary, which can be advantageous for distribution and deployment:

- **Language**: Go (Latest stable version)
- **Framework**: Fiber or Echo
  - Fiber provides Express-like syntax with superior performance
  - Echo offers a robust, minimalist framework with good middleware support
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with GORM
  - GORM provides a feature-rich ORM for Go
  - Supports migrations, relationships, and hooks
- **Authentication**: Custom JWT implementation with golang-jwt
  - Native Go JWT libraries for token generation and validation
  - Argon2id for password hashing
- **API Documentation**: Swaggo
  - Annotation-based Swagger generation
- **Testing**: Go's built-in testing package with Testify

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React 18+
  - Component-based architecture for reusability
  - Virtual DOM for efficient rendering
  - Large ecosystem and community support
- **Build Tool**: Vite
  - Faster development server and build times compared to webpack
  - Modern ES module-based dev server
- **UI Framework**: TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI
  - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
  - ShadCN UI provides accessible, customizable components
  - Responsive design support out of the box
- **State Management**: React Context API + React Query
  - Context API for global state (authentication, themes)
  - React Query for server state management (data fetching, caching, synchronization)
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form
  - Performance-focused form library with validation
  - Minimal re-renders and easy integration with validation libraries
- **Routing**: React Router
  - Declarative routing for React applications
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
  - Vitest for fast, ESM-native unit testing
  - React Testing Library for component testing

### Caddy Integration

- **Caddy Version**: Caddy 2.x (latest stable)
- **Configuration**: JSON API
  - Direct integration with Caddy's Admin API
  - Dynamic configuration generation and application
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics (optional)
  - Caddy provides Prometheus metrics out of the box
  - Can be integrated for monitoring and alerting

## Development Tools

### Version Control

- **Git**: For source code management
- **GitHub/GitLab**: For repository hosting, issue tracking, and CI/CD

### Development Environment

- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For containerized development and deployment
  - Ensures consistent environments across development and production
  - Simplifies dependency management
  - Facilitates easy testing and deployment
- **Node Version Manager (nvm)** or **Go Version Manager (gvm)**:
  - Manages multiple runtime versions
- **ESLint/GolangCI-Lint**: For code quality and style enforcement
- **Prettier**: For consistent code formatting (JavaScript/TypeScript)

### Continuous Integration/Deployment

- **GitHub Actions/GitLab CI**: For automated testing and deployment
  - Runs tests on pull requests
  - Builds and deploys on merges to main branch
  - Generates and publishes documentation
- **Docker Hub/GitHub Container Registry**: For container image hosting

### Monitoring and Logging

- **Logging**: Winston (Node.js) or Zap (Go)
  - Structured logging for easier parsing and analysis
  - Multiple transport support (console, file, external services)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana (optional)
  - Metrics collection and visualization
  - Alerting capabilities
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry (optional)
  - Real-time error tracking and reporting
  - Performance monitoring

## Security Tools

- **HTTPS**: Enforced by Caddy (automatic ACME)
- **CSRF Protection**: Built into frameworks or dedicated middleware
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implemented at the application level
- **Rate Limiting**: Express-rate-limit (Node.js) or built-in middleware (Go)
- **Helmet.js** (Node.js): Security headers package
- **Static Analysis**: SonarQube or similar for code security scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit, Snyk, or Dependabot

## Deployment Options

### Self-Hosted

- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For easy deployment and updates
  - Multi-container setup with proper networking
  - Volume mapping for persistent data
  - Environment variable configuration
- **Systemd Service**: For traditional Linux deployments
  - Process management and auto-restart
  - Log integration with journald

### Cloud Deployment

- **AWS/GCP/Azure**: For cloud hosting
  - EC2/Compute Engine for VM-based deployment
  - ECS/Kubernetes for container orchestration
  - RDS/Cloud SQL for managed database
- **Digital Ocean/Linode/Vultr**: For simpler VPS deployment
  - Droplets/Instances with Docker
  - Managed databases as needed

## Database Considerations

### Primary Database

PostgreSQL is recommended as the primary database for its:
- Robust relational model with JSON support
- Strong data integrity and transaction support
- Excellent performance and scalability
- Rich feature set including full-text search

For simpler deployments, SQLite provides:
- Zero-configuration setup
- Single file database
- Reduced resource requirements
- Suitable for smaller installations

### Database Migration and Backup

- **Migration Tools**: Sequelize migrations (Node.js) or GORM migrations (Go)
- **Backup Strategy**:
  - Automated database dumps
  - Point-in-time recovery options
  - Integration with cloud storage for offsite backups

## Technology Selection Rationale

The recommended technology stack balances several key factors:

1. **Developer Experience**: Tools and frameworks that promote productivity and have good documentation
2. **Performance**: Technologies that provide good runtime performance for responsive user experience
3. **Security**: Components with strong security track records and active maintenance
4. **Community Support**: Technologies with active communities for troubleshooting and future maintenance
5. **Deployment Simplicity**: Solutions that can be easily deployed in various environments
6. **Scalability**: Technologies that can grow with the project's user base and feature set

This technology stack provides a solid foundation for building CaddyManager with all the required features while maintaining good performance, security, and developer productivity.
